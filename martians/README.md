# Martian Robots

A quick little challenge to plot out Martians in a grid, have them move then then report back where they end up!

## Set up

### Prerequisites

Because no difficult set up steps were required you 'just' need node installed on your machine. I've got `v4.3.2` on my dev machine but hopefully it should work on others.
    
### Running the script

This should take care of everything (assuming you are in the `martians` directory).

    $ node robots-on-mars.js

The final outputs are logged out to the console.

## Notes

* Currently the result of the final martian is not the expected result - I may have missed something but even after plotting things on a pad and paper what I have as the result is correct (very keen to be shown what I've done wrong)
* I was about to start refactoring the es6 classes out to use get and set methods (that I realised came built in) - but I hit my time limit
* With the timescale I focused on code that should be easy to refactor moving forward - such as how I manipulated the initial data, moved the bots around and converted strings to numbers and the like
